Certainly, I'll provide descriptive answers for this assignment. I'll include descriptions of any diagrams in square brackets as requested. Let's go through each question:

1. What is meant by Big Data? Explain Big Data in detail.

Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be efficiently managed, processed, or analyzed using traditional data processing methods. It encompasses the volume, velocity, and variety of information that inundates businesses on a day-to-day basis. 

In detail, Big Data is characterized by:

- Volume: The sheer amount of data generated and collected, often in petabytes or exabytes.
- Velocity: The speed at which new data is generated and moves through systems.
- Variety: The diverse types of data, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Veracity: The uncertainty and reliability of data.
- Value: The ability to turn data into meaningful insights and business value.

Big Data technologies and techniques are used to analyze these massive datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can lead to better decision-making and strategic business moves. It's applied in various fields such as business analytics, scientific research, healthcare, finance, and more.

2. Explain the sources of Big Data.

Big Data comes from a wide variety of sources:

a) Social Media: Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram generate vast amounts of user data, including posts, likes, shares, and user interactions.

b) Internet of Things (IoT): Connected devices and sensors continuously stream data about usage, performance, and environmental conditions.

c) Transactional Data: Business systems record data from financial transactions, sales, and customer interactions.

d) Machine-Generated Data: Log files from websites, servers, applications, and networks contribute to Big Data.

e) Public Web: Websites, blogs, and online publications produce large volumes of textual and multimedia content.

f) Scientific Research: Large-scale experiments in fields like physics, genomics, and climate science generate enormous datasets.

g) Surveillance and Security: Video feeds, audio data, and security logs from various monitoring systems.

h) Mobile Devices: Smartphones and tablets produce location data, app usage information, and communication metadata.

i) Healthcare Systems: Electronic health records, medical imaging, and patient monitoring devices generate substantial amounts of data.

j) E-commerce and Digital Marketing: Online shopping behavior, click-stream data, and digital advertising interactions contribute to Big Data.

3. Explain the characteristics of Big Data.

The characteristics of Big Data are often described using the "5 Vs":

a) Volume: This refers to the enormous amount of data generated. We're talking about terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes of data.

b) Velocity: This describes the speed at which new data is generated and moves through systems. Real-time or nearly real-time information makes it possible to be much more agile than competitors.

c) Variety: This refers to the different types of data available. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a relational database. Today's data comes in many forms: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.

d) Veracity: This deals with the uncertainty and reliability of data. With many forms of Big Data, quality and accuracy are less controllable, but Big Data and analytics technology now allows us to work with these types of data.

e) Value: This characteristic is about turning data into value. While the other Vs are important, they mean little if the organization can't turn the data into value.

Some experts also include additional Vs:

f) Variability: This refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by data at times, thus hampering the process of being able to handle and manage the data effectively.

g) Visualization: This refers to the way Big Data is presented. Complex graphs and charts are often necessary to make sense of this data.

4. Explain the types of Big Data.

Big Data can be categorized into three main types:

a) Structured Data:
- This is data that has a defined length and format.
- Examples include numbers, dates, and groups of words and numbers called strings.
- This data is usually stored in relational databases and can be easily mapped into pre-designed fields.
- Examples: SQL databases, spreadsheets.

b) Semi-Structured Data:
- This is data that doesn't conform to strict standards.
- The data has some organizational properties, but lacks a fixed, rigid schema.
- It contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements.
- Examples: XML files, JSON documents.

c) Unstructured Data:
- This refers to data that doesn't fit into traditional row-column databases.
- It doesn't have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner.
- This type of data is growing faster than structured and semi-structured data.
- Examples: text files, social media posts, video files, audio files, images.

5. What are the challenges of Big Data?

Big Data presents several challenges:
