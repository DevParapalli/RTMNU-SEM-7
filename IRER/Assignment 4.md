1. How are wind energy conversion systems classified?

Wind energy conversion systems (WECS) are typically classified based on several criteria:

a) Axis orientation:

- Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT)
- Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT)

b) Power output:

- Small-scale (up to 100 kW)
- Medium-scale (100 kW - 1 MW)
- Large-scale (over 1 MW)

c) Grid connection:

- Grid-connected systems
- Off-grid or standalone systems

d) Application:

- Electricity generation
- Mechanical power (e.g., water pumping)

e) Location:

- Onshore wind turbines
- Offshore wind turbines

2. Explain the working of a single basin tidal power plant.

A single basin tidal power plant operates as follows:

1. Construction: A barrage or dam is built across an estuary or bay with high tidal range.

2. Basin filling: During high tide, water flows through sluice gates into the basin behind the barrage.

3. Gate closure: Once the tide reaches its peak, the sluice gates are closed, trapping water in the basin.

4. Water level difference: As the tide recedes, a height difference develops between the trapped water and the sea level.

5. Power generation: When the height difference is sufficient, water is released through turbines, generating electricity.

6. Cycle repetition: The process repeats with each tidal cycle, typically generating power during ebb tide (outflow).

7. Optional two-way generation: Some plants can generate power during both incoming and outgoing tides, increasing efficiency.

This system harnesses the potential energy of tidal movements to produce clean, renewable electricity.

3. Describe with a neat sketch the working of wind energy (WECS) with main components.

A typical horizontal axis wind energy conversion system (WECS) consists of the following main components and works as follows:

1. Rotor blades: Capture wind energy and convert it to rotational motion.
2. Hub: Connects the blades to the main shaft.
3. Nacelle: Houses the gearbox, generator, and control systems.
4. Gearbox: Increases the rotational speed from the rotor to the generator.
5. Generator: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
6. Yaw system: Orients the turbine to face the wind direction.
7. Tower: Supports the nacelle and rotor at the required height.
8. Foundation: Anchors the entire structure to the ground.

Working principle:

1. Wind flows over the aerodynamically designed blades, creating lift.
2. This lift causes the rotor to spin, converting wind energy to rotational energy.
3. The low-speed rotation of the rotor is increased through the gearbox.
4. The high-speed shaft drives the generator, producing electricity.
5. The yaw system continuously adjusts the turbine's orientation for optimal wind capture.
6. Generated electricity is then conditioned and fed into the grid or storage system.

(Note: As requested, I haven't created a diagram, but this description outlines the main components and working principle of a typical WECS.)


4. Write a note on wave energy conversion machines.

Wave energy conversion machines, also known as wave energy converters (WECs), are devices designed to capture the energy from ocean waves and convert it into usable electricity. There are several types of WECs, each using different mechanisms to harness wave energy:

1. Point absorbers: These are floating structures with components that move relative to each other due to wave action. The relative motion is used to drive electrical generators.

2. Attenuators: Long, snake-like structures oriented parallel to wave direction. They flex with the waves, and this motion is converted to electricity.

3. Oscillating water columns (OWCs): These consist of partially submerged structures with an air chamber above the water. As waves enter and exit the chamber, they push and pull the trapped air, driving a turbine.

4. Overtopping devices: These capture water from waves into a reservoir above sea level, then release it through turbines, similar to hydroelectric plants.

5. Submerged pressure differential devices: These use the pressure difference between wave crests and troughs to drive a fluid through a turbine.

6. Rotating mass devices: These use the motion of waves to spin an eccentric weight, which drives an electric generator.

These machines are still in various stages of development and face challenges such as survivability in harsh ocean environments, efficient power take-off, and cost-effectiveness. However, they represent a promising source of renewable energy, especially for coastal regions.

5. With neat sketch explain basic components of wind Energy conversion system.

As mentioned in the previous answer to question 3, I'll describe the basic components of a wind energy conversion system (WECS) without creating a diagram:

1. Rotor: Consists of blades and hub. The blades capture wind energy and convert it to rotational motion.

2. Nacelle: Houses most of the turbine's components, including:
   a) Low-speed shaft: Connects to the rotor.
   b) Gearbox: Increases rotational speed from the low-speed shaft to the high-speed shaft.
   c) High-speed shaft: Drives the generator.
   d) Generator: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
   e) Brake system: For emergency stops and maintenance.
   f) Cooling system: To prevent overheating of mechanical components.
   g) Yaw drive: Rotates the nacelle to face the wind.
   h) Controllers: Manage the turbine's operations.

3. Tower: Supports the nacelle and rotor, elevating them to heights with stronger, more consistent winds.

4. Foundation: Anchors the entire structure securely to the ground.

5. Transformer: Usually located at the base of the tower, it steps up the voltage for long-distance transmission.

6. Anemometer and wind vane: Measure wind speed and direction to optimize turbine operation.

7. Pitch system: Adjusts the angle of the blades to control rotor speed and power output.

These components work together to capture wind energy, convert it to rotational energy, then to electrical energy, and finally condition it for use in the electrical grid.

6. What are various advantages and disadvantages of W.E.C.S?

Advantages of Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS):

1. Clean and renewable: Produces no direct emissions or pollutants during operation.
2. Low operational costs: Once installed, fuel costs are zero.
3. Land-efficient: Turbines can be placed on existing farms or ranches.
4. Job creation: Provides employment in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.
5. Energy independence: Reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels.
6. Scalability: Can be deployed in sizes ranging from small residential to large utility-scale.
7. Technological maturity: Well-established technology with ongoing improvements.
8. Water conservation: Requires minimal water for operation compared to thermal power plants.

Disadvantages of WECS:

1. Intermittency: Power generation is not constant and depends on wind availability.
2. Initial costs: High upfront investment for installation.
3. Noise pollution: Can produce low-frequency noise, potentially disturbing nearby residents.
4. Visual impact: Large turbines can alter landscapes and scenic views.
5. Wildlife concerns: Potential risk to birds and bats, though modern designs mitigate this.
6. Land use conflicts: May compete with other land uses in densely populated areas.
7. Transmission challenges: Best wind resources are often far from population centers, requiring long transmission lines.
8. Weather dependency: Extreme weather can damage turbines or require shutdown.
9. Shadow flicker: Rotating blades can cast moving shadows, potentially causing disturbance.
10. Material requirements: Some components require rare earth elements, which have their own environmental concerns in mining and processing.

These pros and cons are considered when planning and implementing wind energy projects, with ongoing research and development aimed at maximizing benefits and minimizing drawbacks.


7. Discuss in details the various criteria for site selection for wind turbine power plant.

Selecting an appropriate site for a wind turbine power plant is crucial for its efficiency and economic viability. The following criteria are considered in detail during the site selection process:

1. Wind Resource Assessment:
   - Average wind speed: Ideally, the site should have an annual average wind speed of at least 6-7 m/s at hub height.
