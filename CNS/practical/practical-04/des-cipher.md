# DES Cipher Guide

1. Initial and Final Permutations: These are implemented using the `permute` function, which rearranges bits according to the specified tables.

2. S-boxes: Define the remaining seven S-boxes (S2 to S8) similarly.

3. Key Scheduling: The `generate_subkeys` function needs to be implemented. This involves:
   - Performing the initial key permutation (PC-1)
   - Splitting the key into two 28-bit halves
   - Performing 16 rounds of left shifts and permutations (PC-2) to generate 16 subkeys

4. Feistel Function (f_function): This needs to be implemented, including:
   - Expansion permutation (E)
   - XOR with the round subkey
   - S-box substitutions
   - Permutation (P)

5. Encryption and Decryption: The main structure is provided in `des_encrypt`. `des_decrypt` will be similar but use the subkeys in reverse order.

To complete the implementation:

1. Finish defining all S-boxes.
2. Implement the `generate_subkeys` function for key scheduling.
3. Implement the `f_function` for the Feistel network.
4. Complete the `des_decrypt` function.
5. Add error checking and handling for input sizes and formats.

Remember that this implementation uses integers to represent bit strings for simplicity. In a production environment, you might want to use a more efficient bit manipulation library.

Also, keep in mind that while implementing DES is a great learning exercise, it's not considered secure for modern applications due to its small key size. For real-world use, consider using more modern encryption algorithms like AES.

Would you like me to explain or elaborate on any specific part of this implementation?
